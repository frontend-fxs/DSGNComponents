                    <li>Responsive</li>
                    <li>Mobile first</li>
                    <li>Object oriented CSS</li>

                    <li>Accessibility it’s a must (WCAG 2.0)</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h2>FXStreet frontend architecture</h2>
                  <p>
                    The architecture is builded with the "Atomic design"
                    approach.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The project is using Less.js. In order to ensure maintenance
                    and scalability, each group of components are divided into
                    different LESS files to import all into the final
                    "fxs_screen.min.css" which is the main CSS for the public
                    site.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The widgets for third parties compiles specific less files
                    to generate one common minified CSS (core.min.css) and each
                    widget is compiled in its own minified css
                    (widgetname.min.css).
                  </p>

                  <h2>Less internal rules</h2>
                  <h3>Classes,# &amp; tag styling</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Design and front-end team only style by classes, never by
                      ID (only IT can ad IDs).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Any created class must start with the prefix: fxs_ in
                      order to avoid conflicts with third parties styles.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Use underscores (_) to split words in class names. This
                      will help to find and distinguish easily FXStreet from
                      vendor classes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If an ID it’s needed for js reasons, ask IT team and
                      comment the use of this ID
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Avoid styles any tag directly, this ensure the maintenance
                      of the code.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      There’s a small set of HTML tags styled directly in the
                      reset.less file. Those are the defaults for the website.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  <h2>Vars</h2>
                  <p>
                    The main variables of the site must be on the vars.less
                    file, this will ensure an easy maintainance.
                  </p>
                  <p>The main variables:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Breakpoints</li>
                    <li>Grid system vars</li>
                    <li>Color vars</li>
                    <li>Typo vars</li>
                    <li>Measures, scales, spaces and box sizes</li>
                    <li>Bootstrap vars overrides</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>HEADS UP! All vars must be inside this file.</p>
                  <p>
                    IMPORTANT! Try to insert all measures, colors, sizes, or any
                    possible constant so, if a global change it's needed, it
                    will be as simple as change the var parameters from here.
                  </p>

                  <h2>Extends</h2>
                  <p>
                    In the utilities.less file are contained all the generic
                    classes:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Margins to push or pull objects</li>
                    <li>Modules fix measures</li>
                    <li>Transitions and animations</li>
                    <li>Formatted text styles</li>
                    <li>Generic modules, boxes or fix/hack classes</li>
                    <li>
                      Display and mobile helpers (none, visible, hidden in xs
                      screens, ...)
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>This classes will have CSS output so, keep it clean.</p>
                  <p>
                    All of this classes can be used directly in the HTML,
                    combine it with other classes to dictate properties in an
                    object or can be extended in more complex objects so, once
                    compiled, the common rules will be grouped in the final CSS.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    HEADS UP! Only classes from this file can be extended. It’s
                    a must: Don’t extend from any other files in order to avoid
                    duplicity or long breadcrumbs to find the original CSS rule.
                  </p>

                  <h2>Widgets</h2>
                  <p>
                    All the components for third parties that must works in or
                    outside the FXStreet website: price charts, rates, technical
                    indicators, all the FXS studies charts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For the third parties, there will be two CSS files to
                    deliver: core.min.css and (each) widget.min.css
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <h3>core.min.css</h3>
                      <p>
                        Imports specific less files from the FXS website and
                        force some styles nested in specific fxs_ classes to
                        ensure correct view:
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The idea with this structure it’s to guarantee that the
                        core css will be up to date with the fxs website. The
                        core.min.css will be compiled every time one of the
                        imported files is updated.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        HEADS UP! Don't style any HTML tag without a nesting
                        rule within an .fxs_ class. This widgets are sold to
                        third parties so, a direct style to an HTML tag may
                        crash their website.
                      </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <h3>widget.min.css</h3>
                      <p>Specific styles for each widget.</p>
                      <p>
                        The widgets have different sizes in order to fit in as
                        many layout cols as possible so, almost every widget has
                        three specific classes with different breakpoints. They
                        are organized as follows:
                      </p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          <p>
                            Common default styles: color, font styles, basic
                            layout and chart styling, the common naming for each
                            widget main class is .fxs_widget_widgetname this
                            class combines with contextual classes to set the
                            widget size:
                          </p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              .fxs_widget_mini: The smallest size, to fit in
                              small sizes
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              .fxs_widget_default: The medium size, to fit in
                              spaces = or &gt; half page
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              .fxs_widget_big: The biggest size, to fit in
                              fullpage spaces
                            </li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>
                    Almost all chart widgets uses the c3 charts library. The CSS
                    for this library is imported at the very beginning of the
                    screen.less &amp; core.less files. The overrides of c3
                    library are contained in the components.less file.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    IMPORTANT! Each widget compiles into its own widget.min.css
                    for third parties so, don’t extend classes in the widgets
                    less files, it will works for FXStreet site (due to the
                    @import in screen.less) but it won’t do anything on the
                    standalone version of the widget
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Try every widget on a standalone version without
                    screen.css.min link.
                  </p>

                  <h2>Use of vendor components</h2>

                  <p>
                    Every third party CSS component or styles for js widgets
                    will be in vendor’s folder.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Try to import only the part or the component that will be
                    used: avoid waste of CSS. If possible, import only .less
                    files so it can be compiles within one simple step -This
                    will be explained later-.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    HEADS UP! Don't edit directly from vendor files, override
                    styles &amp; vars into the FXS LESS files. By editing
                    directly changes may be lost in case of updates.

                  <h2>Mobile first!</h2>
                  <p>
                    The FXStreet site is built with a mobile first approach, the
                    CSS and HTML try to built a progressive enhancement
                    experience this means that the first thing to build it’s the
                    core content (HTML) and the basic styles to make sure of the
                    correct visualization across all devices and user agents,
                    then add the cool features and media queries for bigger
                    screens.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The default styles must be always the mobile view without
                    any media queries. Once this view is correct the @media can
                    be added, from smallest to bigger viewports, with min-with,
                    as follows:
                  </p>

                  <h2>Semantic usage of HTML5</h2>
                  <p>
                    The site is built in HTML5 and the correct use of tags must
                    be a common practice: avoid “divitis”.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Use section, article, aside, header, footer, asides,
                    address, ul, ol… be as semantic as possible with each type
                    of content for markup.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    HTML Tags reference:
                    <a
                      href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp."

                  <h2>Object oriented CSS</h2>

                  <p>
                    Always write CSS with the Object Oriented CSS (OOCSS)
                    approach. Means separate structure from skin =&gt; Layout ≠
                    visual features.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When writing think of small pieces that build big components
                    when work together. Build reusable simple objects that can
                    create more complex objects when combined.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    IE: for styling a blue button, think of the future and use
                    of small components, it could be more button styles with
                    other colors, shapes or sizes so, separate the properties
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Button common layout: .fxs_btn</li>
                    <li>Button color: fxs_btn_default</li>
                    <li>Button size: fxs_btn_big</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h2>Naming</h2>
                  <p>
                    Use semantic, descriptive, neutral and visual feature free
                    names:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Don’t set a name by the color, fix measures or any visual
                    feature.
                  </p>

                  <h2>Nesting rules</h2>

                  <p>
                    As shown before, the work of the front-end is to build small
                    parts, components, “bricks” of the building. And each brick
                    must be always a brick no matter where is it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Avoid complex nesting rules, every component must work in
                    every part of the site.
                  </p>

                  <h2>Like Lego</h2>

                  <p>
                    At last, a final tough: think of building CSS components
                    like lego blocks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Take blocks of different sizes and shapes to build the
                    castle or a spaceship, but at the end, each block work with
                    no dependency of other clocks or pieces. And, of course, can
                    be reused in other constructions.
                  </p>

                  <h2>Front-end development mantras</h2>
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      Always edit the less files: Never -under death penalty-
                      edit directly from the CSS files (nor the extended or
                      minified).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The less files must remain without custom, ad hoc or
                      temporally additions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      For topic and landing pages -if it’s needed-, create their
                      custom CSS file and add it via the CSS widget in
                      Sitefinity editor, this will add the custom CSS in the
                      head of the created page.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Avoid complex nesting rules, each component most works
                      correctly within all the site with no dependency of
                      specific nesting rules.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Avoid styling any HTML tag: all styles must depend from
                      classes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Be careful with “divitis”: there are plenty of tags with
                      specific use and with default behaviours.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Comment everything: things may appear obvious until time
                      and people pass.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Communicate constantly with the designer and the front-end
                      lead in order to make sure what to do before styling
                      anything.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Sketch, plan and make conceptual proofs with the team
                      before writing any complex layout use tools as the
                      browser’s inspector or apps like codepen. This will save
                      valuable time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Respect the design but remain flexible: don’t be afraid to
                      take design decisions if any design forces to complicate
                      or twist too much the natural way of the HTML.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Keep It Simple: The most important rule. Don’t override
                      all rules each time, write the necessary lines, not more,
                      not less, double or triple check your code and review it
                      with all available front-ends in FXStreet.
